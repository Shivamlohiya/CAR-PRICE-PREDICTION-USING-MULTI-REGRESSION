# CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-MULTI-REGRESSION

This project predicts the price of cars using **Multiple Linear Regression**, based on features such as brand, year, fuel type, transmission, and more. It demonstrates how regression techniques can be applied to real-world datasets for business insights and decision-making.

# 📌 Project Overview

Car price prediction is essential for dealerships, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions. By analyzing historical data, this project builds a predictive model that estimates car prices with high accuracy using multiple input features.

# 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, outliers, encoding)
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Multiple Linear Regression model implementation
- Model evaluation using R² score, MAE, MSE, RMSE
- Interactive visualizations for price trends
